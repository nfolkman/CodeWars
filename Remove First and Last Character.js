/* Description: It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.  */

// test cases:
 console.log(removeChar('eloquent'))  //'loquen'
